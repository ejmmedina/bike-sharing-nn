# Comparison of Different Algorithms in Predicting Bike Sharing Hourly Count
##### Machine Learning 2.0 mini-project by Justine Bu&ntilde;o, Elijah Justin Medina & Raphael Mari Ongleo

Using manual implementation and Tensorflow library, we predicted the hourly counts of bike sharing users. We found out that Gradient Boosting Method (GBM)
is the most efficient in predicting hourly count with 96:64% accuracy followed
by Tensorflow-Keras with 96:43%. In terms of training the model, even if neural
network is faster to train, the tuning of hyperparameters took longer time to tune
unlike GBM which uses an automated hyperparameter tuning, i.e. GridSearch.
Another observation to note is the extreme changes in test accuracy for different
pre-processing techniques for the self-coded NN.
